    <ol type = "a">
      <li>Can we go over some examples of when to use '==' vs '==='? I think I get it (and I use trial and error when I don't), but it might be helpful to hear it another way.</li>
      <li>Q2: si just want to have another item on the list at this point. I'll probably think of another question, though.</li>
