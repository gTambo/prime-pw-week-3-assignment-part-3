    <ol type = "a">
      <li>Can we go over some examples of when to use '==' vs '==='? I think I get it (and I use trial and error when I don't), but it might be helpful to hear it another way.</li>
      <li>Re: Problem 9; When I pulled the value at a given location in the array 'supplyChanges,' it outputs a string rather than the number there. Is there a more concise way than "Number()" to convert a string to a number when using it inside a function? <br />*EDIT* I just realized I added the numbers to the array as strings for some reason. I then switched them to numbers, changed some syntax and everything still seems to work, and no Number() conversion needed in problem 9.</li>
      <li>Q2: I just want to have another item on the list at this point. </li>
