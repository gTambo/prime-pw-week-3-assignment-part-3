    <h3>Questions from the material</h3>
    <ol type = "a">
      <li>Can we go over some examples of when to use '==' vs '==='? I think I get it (and I use trial and error when I don't), but it might be helpful to hear it another way.</li>
      <li>Re: Problem 9; When I pulled the value at a given location in the array 'supplyChanges,' it outputs a string rather than the number there. Is there a more concise way than "Number()" to convert a string to a number when using it inside a function? <br />*EDIT* I just realized I added the numbers to the array as strings for some reason. I then switched them to numbers, changed some syntax and everything still seems to work, and no Number() conversion needed in problem 9.</li>
      <li>Loops question: so a for - in loop gives only the index of an item as its output, and a for - of loop gives the value at that index? But doe s for - in loop still "see" the value at each location?</li>
      <li>Are there advantages to console-logging different data types in their original format (like keeping a number as a number inside a string in the console log) versus combining them to the same type?</li>
